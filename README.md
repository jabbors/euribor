# euribor

A mobile friendly webapp replacing the defunct iOS app http://www.euriborsapp.com which stopped working early summer 2016. The app lets the user follow the trends for the Euribor reference rates.

Data is taken from https://www.euribor-rates.eu/en/ and stored in this repository. It is updated once a day around 15:00 EEST.

App is available at https://jabbors.github.io/euribor/
