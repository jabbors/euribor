# euribor

This is the home for my backend and frontend serving euribor rates in a mobile friendly web page.

The aim is to create service that will replace the now defunct iOS app http://www.euriborsapp.com which stopped working early summer 2016.

When the backend API and the frontend (not yet existing) is ready, I intend to make the service public.

## future tasks

Another goal is to support some kind of rate monitoring that would alert a user when the desired treshold is reached.
